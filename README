An entry for LD48 #22. It's rather broken and not really complete, but it is
playable! 

Push "Z" to use a match and "X" to count them, though I'm not sure counting
works. You should hear a sound for each match. Your objective in each level is
to get to the green portal before the darkness gets you. 

Sound effects from bfxr. 

Base library is enchant.js from Ubiquitous Entertainment, which I
re-investigated thanks to the prompting of Kazuhiro Sera (@seratch). 

Art, story, and code by Paul O'Leary McCann (@polm23). 

Match counting idea from some article about an old (Atari?) Eye of the Beholder
game where the same method was used for counting arrows. 

Maze generation heavily guided by Wikipedia article on same. 

Idea of giant shrimp in darkness inspired by the light shining through the
fronds of a palm tree on a stormy night as I was half asleep. 

Idea of world destroyed by random meteorite based on true events. -POLM
